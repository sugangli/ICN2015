To build a unified IoT platform in which physical and digital objects can be accessible by application across different organization and domains, many state of art approaches are based on IP-overlay architecture. These solutions inherit the constraints of the current internet, especially in terms of inter-operability, heterogeneity, mobility and security. Thus, we propose a new Information-Centric Network (ICN) based IoT middleware stack adaptable to constraint and unconstrained devices serving different functions from naming, device/service discovery, contextual communication in different segments of an IoT service delivery chain. We then evaluate the service discovery proposal of the middleware functionality over MobilityFirst architecture.

\section{Introduction}
For many years, many standalone Internet of Things (IoT) platforms have been developed and deployed in different domains. The recent trend, however, is to evolve towards a globally unified IoT platform, in which billions of objects connect to the Internet, available for interactions among themselves, as well as interactions with many different applications across boundaries of administration and domains. 


Building a unified IoT platform, however, poses a set of unique challenges and requirements on the underlying network and systems.
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{1mm}\item{\bf Identity}:
To realize a unified IoT platform, the first step is the capability to assign that are unique within the scope and lifetime of each device, data items generated by these devices, or a group of devices towards a common objective.
\vspace{1mm}\item{\bf Heterogeneity}:
IoT devices will have heterogeneous means of connecting to the Internet, and often have severe resource constraints, e.g., constrained resources in power, computing, storage, bandwidth.
\vspace{1mm}\item{\bf Mobility}:
In some scenario, the location of data producer changes by time, and it is not able to provide reliable connection with data consumer. Thus, mobility requirement for a IoT platform is to be capable to deliver IoT data below an application acceptable delay .
\vspace{1mm}\item{\bf Security}:
The heterogenity and openness of the IoT environment imposes great attack surface towards the IoT devices and service. Without carefully considering security concerns such as identity authentication, data integrity and privacy, any IoT platform is hard to be adopted by either end-users or enterprises.
\end{itemize}

%Firstly, it needs to support a large number of networked objects - Cisco predicts there will be around 50 Billion IoT devices (sensors, RFID tags, actuators, etc) on the Internet by 2020 ~\cite{ciscovisual}and many of these object are mobile, for smoothly with respect to metrics like response time, throughput, resolution and routing scalability. Secondly, IoT devices will have heterogeneous means of connecting to the Internet, and often have severe resource constraints, e.g., constrained resources in power, computing, storage, bandwidth. Thirdly, interactions between the applications and objects are often private, contextual, real-time and dynamic, requiring strong security and privacy  protections. 
\subsection{ICN IoT Middleware}
Current approaches towards a unified IoT platform are mostly based upon Internet overlays, whose inherent inefficiencies hinders the platform from satisfying the challenge outlined earlier. In recent years, in order to address  the inefficiencies of today's Internet, Information-Centric Network (ICN) has been proposed. ICN identifies a network object (including a mobile device, content, or service) by application-centric name instead of its IP address, and adopts a name-based routing, lending itself to supporting the unified IoT platform. In this paper, we propose propose a unified IoT middleware which can work properly with various ICN architecture.Shown as Figure~\ref{fig:mid_arch}, the ICN-IoT middleware mainly consists of publish/subscribe management, device/service discovery, context context processing, naming service and discovery service, where the first one is a centralized service while others are implemented in a distributed manner (discussed in Section~\ref{sec:physical}). Within the platform, security component provides necessary security guarantee for all services. It is worth noting that functions in the middleware are required to comply with the IoT deployment requirements and protocol agnostic, and therefore the instantiation of the ICN-IoT middleware may differ depending on the underlying ICN protocol. To be specific, in this paper we will discuss there IoT functions with respect to the hierarchical name-based NDN and flat name-based MobilityFirst.

\subsection{Name Data Networking (NDN)}
NDN~\cite{zhang2010named} provides a receiver-driven architecture by transmitting two types of packets : Interest and Data. Consumer issues Interest of the hierarchical content name and forwards it to Data Producer. When the interest arrives at some node (either intermediate router or Data producer) that owns the requested content, the node will reply the requested content(in the form of Data Packet) along the reverse path to the Data Consumer. NDN provides three types of key components to support such functionality. Forwarding Information Base (FIB) collects the forwarding information at each NDN node. The content prefix and out-face mapping is recorded in the FIB. Once a certain face receives Data packet for a Pending Interest Table , it could be added into the FIB to indicate a healthy data retrieving path.Pending Interest Table (PIT) is a data structure that maintain the set of pending Interest routed by the node that expecting Data packet in return. PIT entry is created by receiving Interest, and filters the redundant Interest that carried the same content name. Due to the limitation of PIT size, every PIT entry comes with a timeout which is estimated based on a round trip time. Once a matching Data packet being received by the node, it is forwarded via the face recorded in the PIT before this entry being removed. Content Store(CS) is a data cache for storing Data packet for matching Interest along the reverse path. Also, due to the constraint of local CS size, Data Producer can define the freshness of the Data packet in order to timeout it in the cache. With such transmission mechanism, NDN eliminates the notion of source and destination as it is in IP network, and handle routing only for Interest Packet.

\subsection{MobilityFirst Background (MF)}\label{sec:intro_mf}
MF~\cite{raychaudhuri2012mobilityfirst} utilizes GUID to name every network object, while separating this GUID from its actual network address. This identifier(GUID)/locator(NA) split design allows MF supporting dynamic address binding, multiple addressing binding and late binding. Shown as Figure ~\ref{fig:mf_arch}, MF core network architecture includes the following network component.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent{\bf Global Name Resolution Service(GNRS)}: GNRS is a centralized service that maintains mappings between GUID and network address. MF routers create the entries by performing an Insert for the GUIDs of attached network devices and the associated network address, and query GNRS for a translation from GUID to latest binding network address. Recent works shows that this translation performance is much better (50-100 ms delay) than DNS resolution~\cite{vu2012dmap}.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent{\bf Hybrid GUID/NA address routing}: Each of the router in MF can make routing decision based on NA or GUID in the header of data packet, since routing decision are made on a hop-by-hop manner~\cite{nelson2011gstar}.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent{\bf Delay-Tolerant Network(DTN)}: The storage in each MF router provides the capability of caching the data packe. Hence, data can be stored or forwarded based on different routing policies, such as quality of the link, which is very useful over wireless interface.

%\subsection{MF Multicast}\label{sec:multi}

\vspace{1mm}\noindent{\bf MF multicast}MF multicast is based on the idea of group GUID that gathers multiple network objects into one entity. Group GUID  to object GUID mapping is a one-to-many mapping that being maintained at GNRS server. Network object can claim to join the multicast group, and either edge router or a centralized management service will perform insertion of the object GUID to group GUID mapping to into GNRS server. When the first router queries GNRS server for a group GUID mapping, GNRS server returns a list of member GUIDs. The router assembles these GUIDs into the header and performs "Longest Common Path(LCP)" algorithm to determine the next hop address.Shown as Figure~\ref{fig:multicast}, routers look up the routing table for these GUIDs, and check if there are multiple next hops. When the number of result is more than one, the router reassembles the header and forwards the copied packet to corresponding interfaces. If the number of multicast group member become significant, another approach can be adopted to resolve this issue--instead of assembling all GUIDs into the header after one query, each router on the path queries GNRS server for the group members and perform LCP to decide next hop.
