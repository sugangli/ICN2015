ICN is a promising architecture for a general purpose future Internet, including Internet of Things. Previous works by Zhang Y. et al~\cite{ietfdraft} states the benefits that ICN network is capable to bring to IoT, including efficient data retrieval, well support of mobility, naming, scalability and security. 

Study by Shang et al.~\cite{shang2014securing} demonstrates a practical use case that integrates NDN with Building Management System (BMS). It shows that human-readable hierarchical naming scheme brings convenience in configuring and managing large number of BACnet devices.

Another study by Amadeo et al.~\cite{amadeo2014multi} provides a solution on efficient multi-source data retrieval. It proposes a method to use one Interest to retrieve multiple data with different suffixes on different location by adjusting the traditional NDN protocol.
