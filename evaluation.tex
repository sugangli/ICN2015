\section{Evaluation}
To evaluate the efficiency of service discovery based on MF-multicast and MF-unicast, we have conducted a detailed experiment in NS3-based MF simulator.  MFã€€network protocol is implemented over standard NS3 P2P module and the experiments are running in a tree-based topology. In MF-multicast case, $Group GUID$ is used to identify a service at unknown location, i.e., service host (SH) can be at any  leaves of the tree while service requester (SR) is at the root of the tree. SR issue a request and the first router then perform  GNRS lookup for the $Group GUID$On receiving of the service request message, the matched receivers will reply with a acknowledgement to the service requester via unicast. While in MF unicast
