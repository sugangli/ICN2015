\section{Evaluation}
We have conducted a detailed experiment of our ICN-IoT middleware in NS-3 simulator. We realize the two functional components discussed in last section. The architecture efficiency and feasibility is evaluated in terms of control overhead and total hop counts metrics.
\subsection{Service Discovery}
\vspace{1mm}\noindent{\bf Experiment Setup}:We use the binary tree topology and vary the number of tiers and potential service providers in the evaluation. We set the service requester attaching to the root node, and the service provider randomly distributed at the leaves of the tree.
