\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a design of a ICN-based middleware to support various IoT application, and define detailed protocol design for the funtionalities of the middleware including device discovery, naming, service discovery and pub/sub management. Through detailed simulation, we find that service discovery over MF multicast introduce less overhead than MF unicast and NDN Selector if multiple service hosts belong to the same service group. To realized a full-fledged ICN-IoT middleware, our next steps are to refine the middleware design details and prototype a ICN based middleware platform suitable for real IoT environments.
