\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present the feasibility of a ICN-based middleware to support various IoT application, and define detailed protocol design for the funtionalities of the middleware. Through detailed simulation, we find that service discovery over MF multicast introduce less overhead than MF unicast if multiple service hosts belong to the same service group. To realized a full-fledged ICN-IoT middleware, our next step will involve prototyping the platform in a real enviroment and develop a naming service for both hierarchical and flat naming scheme.
