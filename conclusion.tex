\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a ICN-based middleware architecture to support various IoT application. We discuss detailed protocol design to support funtionalities of the middleware including device discovery, naming, service discovery and pub/sub management. Through detailed simulation, we find that service discovery over MF multicast introduce less overhead than MF unicast and NDN Selector approach if multiple service hosts belong to the same group. To realize a full-fledged ICN-IoT middleware, our next steps are to refine the middleware design details and prototype a ICN based middleware platform suitable for real IoT environments.
