\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present an ICN-based IoT middleware architecture to support various IoT applications. We discuss the detailed protocol design to support the middleware funtionalities including device discovery, naming service, service discovery and pub/sub management. The simulation result shows that 
%Through detailed simulation, we find that 
service discovery over MF multicast brings less overhead than MF unicast and NDN Selector approaches if multiple service hosts belong to the same group. For the future work, we will refine the middelware design details and prototype an ICN-based IoT middleware platform, and our ultimate target is to realize a full-fledged ICN-IoT middle that fits for real IoT environment.


%To realize a full-fledged ICN-IoT middleware, our next steps are to refine the middleware design details and prototype a ICN based middleware platform suitable for real IoT environments.
